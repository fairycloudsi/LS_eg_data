# LS_eg_data

In this repository we provide data for Linear Regression Model. 

The objective function of minimization problem is 

$
f(x) = \frac{1}{M} * \| b - A x\|^2 + \lambda \|x\|_2^2,
$

where $A$ is the data matrix, b is the label and x is the weights we want to figure out. 

## Dimension set up

We generate matrices by dimension $M \times N$, where 

* d = (3,4,5,6,7,8)';
* N = 2.^d -1;
* M = 2*N; 

## Gaussian distributed data matrix 


GenerateAb_LS_L2.m generates data matrix A and label b. 

* A: each row is independently sampled from a N-dim Gaussian distribution with mean 0 and variance $\Sigma$; 
* x: randomly select N/10 entries of x, each of which is independently sampled from a uniform distribution over support (-2,2);
* b: generated by linear model b = Ax + \epsilon, where \epsilon is sampled from an n-variate Gaussian distribution N(0, I_n). 
* $\Sigma$: covariance matrix of data, the diagonal is always 1 and off-diagonal can be chosen from the set {0, 0.5, 0.75, 0.95}. The larger of off-diagonal values, the ill condition of the data matrix A. 

The data generated by GenerateAb_LS_L2.m are stored in LS_Ab*.mat. 

* $\lambda = 0$, condition number of Hessian and optimum are stores in LS_L2_conda.mat and LS_L2_fopt.m respectively. 

* $\lambda = 0.1/M$ condition number of Hessian and optimum are stores in LS_L2_conda_01.mat and LS_L2_fopt_01.m respectively. 

## UDV data matrix 


UDV matrix is generated by 
$$
A = U * D * V,
$$
where 
* $U$ is orthogonal matrix of dim $M \times N$
* $V$ is orthgonal matrix with dim $N \times N$ 
* $D$ is a diagonal matrix with elements equal distributed from 1 to c
* c is a real number provided, chosen from {20,40,100,200,300,500}, the larger c, the more ill conditioned of matrix A. 

### $\lambda = 0$

* UDV matrix are stored as structure in LS_UDV_lambda0.mat 
* Condition number are stored in LS_UDV_conda_list_lambda0.mat
* Optimum value are stored in LS_UDV_f_opt_lambda0.mat

### $\lambda = 0.1/M$

* UDV matrix are stored as structure in LS_UDV_lambda01.mat 
* Condition number are stored in LS_UDV_conda_list_lambda01.mat
* Optimum value are stored in LS_UDV_f_opt_lambda01.mat
